# ScrapMechanicReader
This project contains a collection of readers that can parse files made by the game ScrapMechanic.


#### Ideas

The plan right now is to read as much as I can about reversing and looking into the game for clues about how stuff will work.
I'm working on a lua deserializer right now.


### Example
There are examples for how to use this api.
See [Example.java](/src/main/java/com/hardcoded/example/Example.java).
